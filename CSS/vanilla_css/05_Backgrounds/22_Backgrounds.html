      Mujeeb with a magic over that will see celebrations from Kabul to Kandahar
      (I hope they're geographically far apart because that's the best Afghan
      alliteration I can manage). After toying with Chris Woakes all over,
      including trapping him in front only for him to be thwarted on review,
      Mujeeb castles him with a googly Woakes is cluelss about. It disturbs
      timber, and the world champions are on the brink! "Impressive crowd in at
      the Arun Jaitley Stadium tonight - perhaps the best atmosphere for a game
      that hasn't involved India in the tournament to date," Matt says from
      Delhi. "They have been particularly vocal in their support for Rashid Khan
      - both with bat and ball - and there are plenty of Afghanistan flags in
      the stands, perhaps no surprise given the Afghan diaspora here in Delhi.
      The crowd numbers have undoubtedly been helped by the fact this game is
      being played on a Sunday evening, but it has been heartening to see so
      many fans in after some poor turnouts in the first 10 days of this
      tournament."

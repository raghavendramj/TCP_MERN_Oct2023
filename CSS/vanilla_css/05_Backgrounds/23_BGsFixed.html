        Mujeeb with a magic over that will see celebrations from Kabul to
        Kandahar (I hope they're geographically far apart because that's the
        best Afghan alliteration I can manage). After toying with Chris Woakes
        all over, including trapping him in front only for him to be thwarted on
        review, Mujeeb castles him with a googly Woakes is cluelss about. It
        disturbs timber, and the world champions are on the brink! "Impressive
        crowd in at the Arun Jaitley Stadium tonight - perhaps the best
        atmosphere for a game that hasn't involved India in the tournament to
        date," Matt says from Delhi. "They have been particularly vocal in their
        support for Rashid Khan - both with bat and ball - and there are plenty
        of Afghanistan flags in the stands, perhaps no surprise given the Afghan
        diaspora here in Delhi. The crowd numbers have undoubtedly been helped
        by the fact this game is being played on a Sunday evening, but it has
        been heartening to see so many fans in after some poor turnouts in the
        first 10 days of this tournament."

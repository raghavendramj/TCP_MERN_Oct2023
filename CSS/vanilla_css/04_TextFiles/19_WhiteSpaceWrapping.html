    <h1>White Space - Demo!</h1>

      India's second match of this tournament was billed as Kohli's homecoming,
      his second and final World Cup appearance in the city he grew up in.
      Twelve years ago, he made 12 off 20 balls in a low-key win over the
      Netherlands; now, he was the man whose name featured on every other blue
      jersey in the 32,000-strong crowd.

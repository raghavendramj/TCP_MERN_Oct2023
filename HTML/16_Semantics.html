    <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
    <p>Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.</p>
    <p>
      A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and
      the developer.
      <!-- Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. -->

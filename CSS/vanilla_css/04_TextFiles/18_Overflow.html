      They came for Virat Kohli, but they got Rohit Sharma. This was an
      exhibition of white-ball batting in Delhi, as India's captain turned a
      chase of 273 - which Afghanistan hoped would prove awkward - into a
      glorified middle practice, treating their seamers with the disdain usually
      reserved for net bowlers. India's second match of this tournament was
      billed as Kohli's homecoming, his second and final World Cup appearance in
      the city he grew up in. Twelve years ago, he made 12 off 20 balls in a
      low-key win over the Netherlands; now, he was the man whose name featured
      on every other blue jersey in the 32,000-strong crowd.
